Just a simple static site I made as my personal website - to display my projects and any articles I may write in the future

Not yet populated with articles or projects, however basic features and functionality is implemented

Used [HUGO](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) with the [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) theme
### Features to improve / add:
- implement simple snowfall animation as background
- have table of contents on CV page, alongside option to download CV pdf
- ability to comment
- fix search so works properly
- remove (default) option to go into dark mode
